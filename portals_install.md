# Installing files for [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J50EJ_HQ04k): 
You can download the file from the modrinth website here: https://modrinth.com/mod/immersiveportals/versions and choose the 1.20.4 version (unless you are not using 1.20.4). I was using the v5.1.8 1.20.4 (alpha) but if this doesn't work try the release.

Then get the file and put it in your curseforge installation folder here:
*there is a pause in the video so wait like 5 seconds*
